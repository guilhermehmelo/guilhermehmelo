## 🌱 About Me

I'm a technology enthusiast who decided to turn curiosity into code.

Currently building my foundation in web development and programming logic, 
learning step by step how systems work — not just how to use them, but how to create them.

I believe growth is built through consistency, practice, and courage to start before feeling ready.
